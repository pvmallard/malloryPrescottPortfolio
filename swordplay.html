        <p>Swordplay is a collaborative motion capture project utilizing the ATLAS Blackbox Theatre, visuals, aduio, and programming. </p>

                <p>We programmed the space to interact with the movements of two trackers that you and a friend could hole to fight each other to the death. Experience swordfighting in four different fun environments.</p>
                <p>When infinite possibilities for motion capture and utilizing the space we had, of course we chose to give people the chance to experience movie magic sword fights for themselves. We began our planning by deciding how we would divide up the physical space, how we would code it to do that, and what different cases we wanted the trackers to have. The spaces we chose for sword fighting were pirate, video game, space, and fantasy, so we worked on getting visuals and audios for each.</p>
                <p>For the sake of saving time, we sought out free sound and wav files for the sword sound effects and the background music for each space. As for the visuals, we used stable diffusion for the AI generated images and animations. Honestly it was interesting giving it a shot.</p>

              <p>The coding was the most difficult part as we were all unfamiliar with how to code using max, especially on such a large scale. But thankfully with the help of our professor, we were able to get it worked out and actually accomplish our sword-fighting-vision.</p>
