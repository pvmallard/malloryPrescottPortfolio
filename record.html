        <p>Based on the iconic gramophone, a project that allows the user to mix and match drum tracks and melodies to create their own music.</p>

                <p> We accomplished this utilizing various fabrication techniques alongside circuits, motors, sensors, and Arduino and Processing code.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, we knew we wanted our project to involve sound. After we solidified our project idea, we focused on obtaining all the materials needed and began making concepts/prototypes of our enclosure. Many of our original ideas for this project changed as time went on.</p>
                <p>We used the laser cutter and plywood to create the pieces of our enclosure. Our first prototype was created with cardboard in case we had to make any changes to the design. For the laser cutting guidelines, we used Adobe Illustrator and uploaded it to the laser cutter. The Illustrator files had to be changed a little bit for the final enclosure.</p>
                <p>Our project has two motors: a DC motor and a servo motor. The DC motor spins the disk and the servo motor rotates the arm. Both of these motors will activate based on ultrasonic distance sensors. The sensors will be detecting whether or not a disk has been placed above them at a certain range. </p>

              <p>At first, we decided to have 10 songs for our project which we stored in a folder on the computer inside the same folder as the processing file. We were going to have four potentiometers for our record player to control the song, the volume, the pitch, and the tempo. However, we decided we wanted to be more creative with our project and instead decided to make several different drum tracks and melody tracks that could be mixed and matched and changed with the potentiometers. The music for our project was created in Ableton Live 11. </p>
              <p>There was a lot to implement for the code, see more on the ‘Learn More’ button. Once the code was implemented and tested, we made some cardboard mockups of the disk and arm to test how they could move with the added weight. Both the DC and Servo motors worked well. </p>
              <p>We began constructing our final enclosure by laser cutting plywood, sanding it down, and using dark brown wood stain to color the wood darker, but still have it look natural. We then hot-glued all the parts together. Thank you to the BTU for letting us use their materials and laser cutter.</p>
              <p>Various testing, soldering, fabrication, and repeated reconstruction and modification followed, eventually resulting in a cohesive final project we were free to test. We were very proud of what we learned over the duration of the project as well as with how it came out. We were even able to submit it the Atlas Expo to show off all our hard work. It was a great experience and we really adapted with the challenges we faced.</p>
